Description:
	Web app that generates a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive)
	and prompts the user to guess what the number is. The user's guess is
	compared to the random number and advises the user whether the guess is too
	low, too high, and there is a match.  The game ends when the user guesses the
	number.
