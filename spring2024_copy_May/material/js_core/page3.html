        <h2>Unobtrusive Javascript</h2>
       
        <div class="box warn">
            <strong>Reminder:</strong>
            Adhere to Progressive Enhancement (PE) principles to create valid HTML5 and CSS3 documents before adding Javascript. Everything must be fully functional without Javascript.
            
            <p>Unobtrusive JavaScript is not a technique as such; unobtrusive JavaScript is not a matter of adding one makeUnobtrusive() function to your scripts in order to enter nirvana. Instead, it’s a way of thinking. To make sure that your scripts do not inconvenience anyone, you should make sure your scripts do not make any assumptions.</p>
        </div> 
        
  
       <dl>
        <dt>
          <strong> Assumption</strong>: everybody’s browser supports JavaScript.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>Not true:</strong> In order to be unobtrusive to users, taking away the script should not preclude them from using your site, even though their interaction will be far less rich than that of users whose browser does support JavaScript.
        </dd>
      </dl>  

      <dl>
        <dt>
          <strong> Assumption</strong>: all browsers work the same.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>Not true:</strong> In order to be unobtrusive to browsers, your script should steer clear of plain errors and compatibility problems, and take special devices such as speech browsers or mobile phones into account.
        </dd>
      </dl>
    

      <dl>
        <dt>
          <strong> Assumption</strong>: everybody else will understand my code.
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>Not true:</strong> In order to be unobtrusive to fellow programmers, your script should consist of clear, clean code and feature a lot of comments to say what your code is (supposed to be) doing.
        </dd>
      </dl>


        <h3>The principles to follow include:</h3>
        <ol class="ordered-list">
            <li><strong>delay processing by including it at the end of body</strong>, after all marked up content.</li>
            <li><strong>accelerate processing to the event</strong> <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>, before the window is loaded and rendering.</li>
            <li><strong>avoid control boxes</strong> (alert, prompt,...), they pause all processing until the user dismisses them.</li>
        <li><strong>avoid event attributes</strong>, you are mixing languages; hard to maintain.</li>
        <li>ultimately, <strong>move all Javascript to an external file(s)</strong>.</li> 
        </ol>  
        
        <p class="blockquote-footer">Read further  <cite title="[ Unobtrusive JavaScript defined ]"><a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/The_principles_of_unobtrusive_JavaScript#Unobtrusive_JavaScript_defined" target="_blank">  <q>The principles of unobtrusive JavaScript</q> on W3C</a></cite></p>   

        <h3>Delay code processing</h3>
        <p>Unobtrusive JavaScript places all script code in an external file and specifies a function to the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event to set behaviours when the HTML document has loaded.</p>
        
        
       	
        <p>Linking your Javascript file at the bottom of the document will let you control the rendering of the page better and can avoid some nasty performance problems with the way browsers render and execute Javascript.</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code>&lt;script src="js/script.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code></pre>			
        <p>Include scripts at the bottom of the body element. 
        <span style="color:red;">(Also see attributes <code>defer</code> and <code>async</code>  for external Javascript files.)</span></p>
                           
        <p>By externally linking your CSS and Javascript files, you are allowing the browser to cache them in memory for each user. This improves the performance from the user's perspective by minimizing HTTP requests and downloading, hence speeding up the load time.</p>   
        

        <h3>Accelerating Initialization</h3>    
        <p>To ensure that the Javascript processing is done as soon as the Document Object Model (DOM) is ready to be access, use the event listener:</p>

        <pre class="language-js"><code>document.addEventListener( "DOMContentLoaded", initFunction, false )</code></pre>
      </div>
