        <h4>Description (example)</h4>
        <p>A two-player game based on [1]. The players are presented with a gameboard of three-by-three grid and a button to start a new game. Once the game starts, players take turn selecting one of the nine open squares (available or empty cells) until one player wins or the game is "a scratch" [2]. A player wins when they complete a row, a column, or a diagonal first. When a winning state occurs, a message is presented that the game is over and who the winner is.</p>

        <p>Although we want to stay technology agnostic, we index the cells starting with 0, anticipating the use of arrays (most computing languages use 0-indexed)</p>

            <summary>First pass may look like this</summary>
            <pre>
1. start game with a three-by-three grid of nine empty cells, two players named x and o, x holding a marker (pen)
2. x marks an empty cell    // turn 1, 8 cells left
3. check if winner          // no need to check [x]
4. x passes marker to o
5. o marks an empty cell    // turn 2, 7 cells left
6. check if winner          // no need to check [xo]
7. o passes marker to x
8. x marks an empty cell    // turn 3, 6 cells left
9. check if winner          // no need to check [xox]
10. x passes marker to o
11. o marks an empty cell   // turn 4, 5 cells left
12. check if winner         // no need to check [xoxo]
13. o passes marker to x
14. x marks an empty cell   // turn 5, 4 cells left
15. check if winner         // three x's can be in a row, col, or diag [xoxox]; 
                            // if yes, declare winner and end game.
16. x passes marker to o    // if no, continue
17. o marks an empty cell   // turn 6, 3 cells left
18. check if winner         // if yes, declare winner and end game.
19. o passes marker to x    // if no, continue
20. x marks an empty cell   // turn 7, 2 cells left
21. check if winner         // if yes, declare winner and end game.
22. x passes marker to o    // if no, continue
23. o marks an empty cell   // turn 8, 1 cell left
24. check if winner         // if yes, declare winner and end game.
25. o passes marker to x    // if no, continue
26. x marks an empty cell   // turn 9, 0 cells left
27. check if winner         // if yes, declare winner and end game.
                            // if no winner declare a TIE and end game.
28. end game                // start new game?

            <summary>Second pass may look like this</summary>
            <pre>
1. start game with a three-by-three grid of nine empty cells, two players named x and o, x holding a marker (pen)
2. current player marks an empty cell         // decrement or increment a counter to track turns 
3. we check if we have a winner               // TODO: add condition, when turn > 4
4. if yes, declare a winner and end the game.
5. if no empty cells left AND no winner, declare a tie and end the game.
6. flip to other player, go back to step 2    // NOTE:  game must end in step 4 or 5 only!!!

            <summary>Third pass (and subsequent passes)</summary>
            <ul>
                <li>manually run through the game, adding details as they emerge</li>
                <li>a common approach is to write test cases; take each test case and walk through your code; think of a typical case and boundary cases (ie. x wins with a column, x wins with a row, x wins with a diagonal, o wins with ..., there is a tie,...).</li>
                <li>During every walk-through, write down your observations. After the walk through add to or modify your algorithm. Keep in mind that if you make changes to your algorithm, you need to retest all test cases.</li>
                <li>Ideally, test all possibilities - which might not be feasible, later learn to formal testing techniques and to use tools that automate testing.   </li>

        <h4>Designing your solution(s)</h4>
        <p>Consider several potential solutions. Compare and analyze several solutions. Select the one that best addresses the current situation.  A single solution may be the best in some situations, but not all situations.</p>
        <p>Here is a working solution for a tic tac toe game:<br>
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/ebajcar/4b9d256f4caa25242c017a1186ea4749" target="_blank">Code ttt_v0_obtrusive.html</a>
        </p>
        <p>Discuss what is good and bad about this solution. Questions to discuss include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Is the solution using unobtrusive Javascript?</li>
            <li>Is the algorithm similar to what you have designed (chosen)? in what ways? </li>
            <li>Do you think all browsers will work the same?</li>
            <li>Is the code understandable?  Describe in your own words.</li>
            <li>Is the processing of Javascript delayed to accelerated to the event DOMContentLoaded?</li>
            <li>Does the code use control boxes and event attributes?</li>
            <li>Is the code reusable (write once, use many times)? Does it effectively use control structures?</li>
            <li>How would you fix and improve the code to adhere to the principles of unobtrusive Javascript?</li>
        </ol>
