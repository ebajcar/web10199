<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
<p>The instructions discussed previously are not the rich instructions of a human language. A computer only has a limited number of well-defined, simple instructions. </p>
<p>Instructions are represented within the computer as numbers - the code for "copy" might be 001, for example. The particular instruction set that a specific computer supports is known as that computer's machine language. </p>
<p>In practice, people do not normally write the instructions for computers directly in machine language but rather use a "high level" programming language which is then translated into the machine language automatically by special computer programs (interpreters and compilers). </p>
<p>Some programming languages map very closely to the machine language, such as assembler (low level languages); at the other end, languages like Prolog are based on abstract principles far removed from the details of the machine's actual operation (high level languages).</p>


<h3>Computer Programs</h3>
<p>Computer programs are simply large lists of instructions for the computer to execute, perhaps with tables of data. </p>
<p>Many computer programs contain millions of instructions, and many of those instructions are executed repeatedly. A typical modern PC can execute around 2-3 billion instructions per second.</p>
<p>Computers do not gain their extraordinary capabilities through the ability to execute complex instructions. Rather, they do millions of simple instructions arranged by clever people, "programmers."</p>
<p>Good programmers develop sets of instructions to do common tasks (for instance, draw a dot on screen) and then make those sets of instructions available to other programmers.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most computers appear to execute several programs at the same time. This is usually referred to as multi-tasking. </p>
<p>In reality, the CPU executes instructions from one program, then after a short period of time, it switches to a second program and executes some of its instructions. This small interval of time is often referred to as a time slice. This creates the illusion of multiple programs being executed simultaneously by sharing the CPU's time between the programs.</p>
<p>This is similar to how a movie is simply a rapid succession of still frames. The operating system is the program that usually controls this time sharing. </p>
<p>Contemporary computers put the ALU and control unit into a single integrated circuit known as the Central Processing Unit (CPU). Typically, the computer's memory is located on a few small integrated circuits near the CPU. Some larger computers differ from the above model in one major respect - they have multiple CPUs and control units working simultaneously.</p>
<p>The functioning of a computer is therefore in principle quite straightforward. The computer fetches instructions and data from its memory. The instructions are executed, the results are stored, and the next instruction is fetched. This procedure repeats until the computer is turned off.</p>

<h3>Code</h3>
<p>Code refers to a program written in a programming language. You will encounter several kinds of computer code.</p>

<ul class="f-switch dense align-items:stretch" role="list">
  <li class="box"><strong>Pseudocode</strong> is a common tool in program design, pseudocode is an outline of the program written in abbreviated English. It is laid out to resemble the structure of the actual program.</li>
  <li class="box"><strong>Source Code</strong> is a computer program written in a high-level language is called source code. Source code is stored in an ASCII text file. (Entered by programmer with a text editor)</li>
  <li class="box"><strong>Assembly Code</strong> is a computer program written in assembly language is called, appropriately, assembly code.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="f-switch dense align-items:stretch" role="list">
  <li class="box"><strong>Library Code</strong> Some language, such as C, provide libraries of pre-compiled functions and routines. This library code can be linked to object code to make a complete program.
</li>
<li class="box"><strong>Executable Code</strong> or <strong>Binary code</strong> that can be run directly by the computer is called executable code. Depending on the language, it may consist of both object code and library code.
</li>
<li class="box"><strong>Scripting Languages</strong>
An interpreter is a program that executes other programs. The interpreter steps through the source code, translating and executing each instruction as it encounters it.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The functioning of a computer is therefore in principle quite straightforward. The computer fetches instructions and data from its memory. The instructions are executed, the results are stored, and the next instruction is fetched. This procedure repeats until the computer is turned off.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>All computers, from large supercomputers costing millions of dollars to smaller desktop personal computers, must perform a minimum set of functions and provide capability to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Accept input</li>
  <li>Display output</li>
  <li>Store information in a logically consistent format (traditionally, binary)</li>
  <li>Perform arithmetic and logical operations on either the input or stored data</li>
  <li>Monitor, control, and direct overall operation and sequencing of the system</li>
</ul>
<p>The physical components are collectively referred to as hardware.</p>

<h3>Memory Unit</h3>
<p>This unit stores information in a logically consistent format. Typically, both instructions and data are stored in memory, usually in separate and distinct areas. Each computer contains memory of two fundamental types: RAM and ROM</p>
<ul class="f-switch dense align-items:stretch" role="list">
<li class="box"><strong>Random Access Memory (RAM)</strong> is usually volatile, which means that whatever is stored there is lost when the computer's power is turned off. Your programs and data are stored in RAM while you are using the computer. The size of a computer's RAM is usually specified in terms of how many bytes are available to the user. Personal computer memories currently consists of from 32 to 512 million bytes.</li>
<li class="box"><strong>Read-only Memory (ROM) </strong>contains fundamental instructions that cannot be lost or changed by the casual computer user. These instructions include those necessary for loading anything else into the machine when it is first turned on and any other instructions the manufacturer requires to be permanently accessible when the computer is turned on. ROM is non-volatile; its contents are not lost when the power goes off.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Control Unit</h3>
<p>The control unit, <strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong>, directs and monitors the overall operation of the computer. It keeps track of where in memory the next instruction resides, issues the signals needed to both read data from and write data to other units in the system, and executes all instructions.</p>

<h3>Arithmetic Logic Unit</h3>
<p>The <strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</strong> performs all the arithmetic and logic functions, such as addition, subtraction, comparison, and so forth, provided</p>

<h3>Input/Output Unit</h3>
<p>The <strong>Input/Output Unit (I/O) </strong> provides access to and from the computer. It is the interface to which peripheral devices such as keyboard, cathode array screens, and printers are attached. Input devices (keyboard, mouse, scanner) trigger instructions to be processed. The most common output device is the <strong>video display terminal (VDT)</strong>, also called monitor.</p>

<h3>Secondary Storage</h3>
<p>Because <abbr title="Random Access Memory ">RAM</abbr> memory in large quantities is still relatively expensive and volatile, it is not practical as a permanent storage area for programs and data. Secondary or auxiliary storage devices are used for this purpose. Although data have been stored on punched cards, paper tape, and other media in the past, virtually all secondary storage is now done on magnetic tape, magnetic disks, and optical storage media</p>

<h2>Computer Use</h2>
<p>Computers are tools that assist and ease cumbersome and seemingly impossible tasks. Not all tools are physical devices, some are instructions and methods, that instruct us how to accomplish a goal, such as solve mathematical problem. Many of these tasks require only a human brain, some paper, and a pencil. Without computers, many tasks would require countless hours of hand calculations. </p>
<p>In any case, NO ONE should depend completely on computers. NEVER blindly trust a computer’s output. Always check your input. To check your computer software’s results, use traditional pencil-and-paper analysis. Always remember that computers are incredibly useful tools that require diligence and understanding.</p>

<ul class="f-switch dense align-items:stretch" role="list">
<li class="box">It starts with decent default styling for vanilla HTML, akin to <strong>classless
CSS</strong> libraries, that can be customized with <strong>CSS variables.</strong></li>
<li class="box">It offers a small set of <strong>components</strong> based on well-known, semantic markup
patterns, with ARIA where appropriate.</li>
<li class="box">Finally, it offers a small &amp; curated set of <strong>utility classes</strong> and <strong>custom
elements</strong> for the things HTML hasn't caught up with yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of missing.css is to reduce needed intervention in HTML. It lets
authors</p>
<ul class="flow-gap dense">
<li>start with a good out-of-the-box experience,</li>
<li>customize it easily, even create multiple themes,</li>
<li>build common components using plain, semantic HTML,</li>
<li>create unique sites by applying utility classes as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though it's quite early, there are a few sites using missing.css:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hyperscript.org">https://hyperscript.org</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.davidaflood.com">https://www.davidaflood.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Missing.css is a notch on the complexity slider
that's just right for small projects and personal sites
where classless CSS is not enough, Tailwind is too much
and Bootstrap just doesn't have the right vibe.</p>
<p>We also have a <a href="/docs/js">JavaScript library</a> and a <a href="https://prismjs.com">Prism</a> syntax theme.</p>
