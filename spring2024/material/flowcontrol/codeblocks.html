    <h2>Code blocks</h2>
		<p>You need to provide users with certain website functions only under certain conditions. 	Without program flow, JavaScript programs would process from top to bottom in the order in which the code is written. Program flow can be conditional, iterative, or behavioural. Conditional program flow is used on evaluating state to make a decision as to which code should run.  Iterative flow processes lists and collections of information systematically and consistently.  Behavioural flow is defined as an event or callback in which specific logic is applied based on user engagement with the application or completion of another task. Exception handling is a special type of program flow to run specific logic in the case of an error in the program.</p>

		<h5>JavaScript Code Blocks</h5>	
		<p>JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}. The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together. One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions.</p>
		<p>JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed. JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables. <code>break, continue, debugger, do...while, fore, if...else, return, switch, try...catch, var</code>.</p>		
		<h5>Flow Control Statements</h5> 
       <ol>
            <li>An <code>if</code> statement performs a conditional test and will only execute the statements it contains when the evaluation is true</li>
            <li>An <code>else</code> statement can be added after an if statement to provide an alternative for when the evaluation is false</li>
            <li>Multiple alternative branches can be provided after an if statement with subsequent else if statements</li>
            <li>A <code>switch</code> statement is often preferable to an if statement when there are many conditions to test</li>
            <li>Each <code>case</code> statement must be terminated by a break keyword</li>
            <li>A default statement may be included at the end of a switch statement block to specify default statements to execute when no specified case values match the result of the evaluation </li>
            <li>The <code>for</code> loop begins with an initializer, a test condition, and a modifier within parentheses after the for keyword</li>
            <li>A loop modifier must change a value in the test condition so that the evaluation will become false and the loop will exit</li>
            <li>When the required number of iterations is an unknown quantity a <code>while</code> loop is often preferable to a for loop</li>
            <li>A <code>do while</code> loop can be used when the statements it contains absolutely must be executed at least once. <a data-toggle="popover"  role="button" tabindex="0" title="do while Structure" data-content="is also known as until &mdash; repeat something until some condition occurs.">do while</a> </li>
            <li>The statement block of a while loop and a do while loop must contain a modifier to change a value in the test condition</li>
            <li>A <code>break</code> statement immediately exits a loop</li>
            <li>Optionally, a loop structure may be labelled to allow a break statement in a nested loop to exit both loops</li>
            <li>A <code>continue</code> statement stops execution of a single iteration of a loop and flow resumes at the start of the next iteration</li>
