Description:
	console procedural version
	Program to play the casino game of Craps. 
	At the beginning of the game, 
		the player rolls a pair of dice and computes the total. 
		If the total is 2, 3, or 12 (called "craps"), the player loses. 
		If the total is 7 or 11 (called a "natural"), the player wins.
		If the total is any other number, that number becomes the "point". 
			From here, the player keeps rolling the dice until 
				(a) the point comes up again, in which case the player wins, or 
				(b) a 7 appears, in which case the player loses. 
				The numbers 2,3,11, and 12 no longer have special 
					significance after the first rolls.
