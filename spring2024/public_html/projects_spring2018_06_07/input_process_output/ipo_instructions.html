Description:
	Problem:
	What is the sum of two numbers?
	
	Description of the problem:
	1. identify the goal, elements and relations within the domain of the problem (system)
		Objective: 	find the result of adding two numbers together
					find quantity S (variable)
		Elements: 	quantity X
					quantity Y
		Relations:	assignment (equals,=)
					addition (plus,+)
		Constraints:	what is a number?
						where does it come from?
						where does it go? 
	2. model the system! potential solution
						S = X + Y (calculation)
						X + Y = S (presentation only)
	3. test with valid and invalid quantities 
	
	4. update constraints and assumptions
		datatypes? integer, real, hex, bin, complex, scientific notaiton, NaN
		how large? small? negative, signed, unsigned
	5. validate assumptions by asking questions (customer, team members)
	6. evaluate and update model
			1. obtain X  	(how? ask user, pass parameters, retrieve from file...)
			2. record X		(how? write down, save as variable,...)
			3. obtain Y		(how? ask user, pass parameters, retrieve from file...)
			4. record Y		(how? write down, save as variable,...)
			5. calculate S (S=X+Y) 	(how? )
			6. provide S (S=X+Y)	(how? tell, send, display,...)
		front-end development: how will user interact? what controls are best? 
			what will user see and do? how we can help?
		this solution works for manual process, back-end and front-end
