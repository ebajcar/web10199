		<h1>Instructions</h1>
		<p>Read the word(s) in the first column and select the description that best expresses how you usually handle each situation.</p>
		<p>Many responses probably fall in one column, with several in another column, and very few in the remaining one. The column that represents your actions best is your primary processing style.  The second highest is your auxiliary style. Though this test is not very technical or complicated, most adults know how they respond to situations.</p>
		<p>By spending time thinking about reactions, you can identify how you prefer to process information. This assessment looks at your modality preferences.	When you press the Submit button, your primary and auxiliary processing style will be displayed, together with some suggestions how to take advantage of your strengths.</p>
