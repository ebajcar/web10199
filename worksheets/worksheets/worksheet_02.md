# Worksheet 2

#### SYST10199 Web Programming

Set up a project for each problem. Keep all versions of your solution for each project.
Watch video on [Algorithms](https://youtu.be/6hfOvs8pY1k). For each problem, write out the
algorithm that you plan to use (and modify if your implementation deviates from your original
plan).

### Problem A: Fibonacci numbers

1. Write a program that displays the first 20 Fibonacci numbers in the console.
2. Refactor your code to display a table in the console (see `console.table()` property).
3. Extend the program to capture user’s input to determine how many numbers to display.

### Problem B: Convert temperature

1. Write a program that calculates 25 degrees Celsius in Fahrenheit and displays a phrase\
   that includes both values in the console.
2. Modify your program to display on the page.
3. Extend the program to capture user's input to determine what value to convert.\
   Display on the page with two (2) decimal places.

### Problem C: Calculate the area of a circle

1. Write a simple program that computes the area of a circle \
   when the `radius = 4`.\
   Explore the Math object (pow, π). Output to console.
2. Extend the program to get the value from the user. Display on the page.

### Problem D: Calculate roots of a quadratic equation

1. Write a program that calculates roots of a quadratic equation. Implicit equation of a line,
   when `a != 0`, there are two solutions to `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` and they\
   are `x = -b +- sqrt(b^2-4ac) over 2a`. Display the result in the console,\
   when `a=4`, `b=3`, and `c=2`.
2. Extend the problem to display the results on the page.

### Problem E: Calculate prime numbers

1. Write a program that displays the first 20 prime numbers (starting with 2). Display in console.
2. Extend the program to display on the page.
3. Modify the program to display the numbers in an unordered list.

&bull; [JavaScript building blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks)
In this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code block such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events. You've seen this stuff already in the course, but only in passing — here we'll discuss it all explicitly.

&bull; [Making decisions in your code — conditionals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals)
In any programming language, code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime. In this article we'll explore how so-called conditional statements work in JavaScript.
