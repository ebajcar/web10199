### W3 Consortium (specifications)

[W3C - HTML 5.3 - Section 4.10. Forms](http://w3c.github.io/html/sec-forms.html)  &mdash;
A form is a component of a Web page that has form controls, such as text fields, buttons, checkboxes, range controls, 
or color pickers. A user can interact with such a form, providing data that can then be sent to the server for further 
processing (e.g., returning the results of a search or calculation). No client-side scripting is needed in many cases, 
though an API is available so that scripts can augment the user experience or use forms for purposes other than submitting 
data to a server.&hellip;</dd>

### MDN tutorials

[Form data validation (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Data_form_validation)

Form validation helps us to ensure that users fill out forms in the correct format, making sure that submitted data will work 
successfully with our applications. This article leads you through basic concepts and examples about form validation.

<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions" target="_blank">Javascript Guide: Regular Expressions</a>

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are 
also objects. These patterns are used with the exec and test methods of RegExp, and with the match, replace, search, and 
split methods of String&hellip;

## Regular Expressions

### [Character classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes)
`\`, `.`, `\cX`, `\d`, `\D`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\s`, `\S`, `\t`, `\v`, `\w`, `\W`, `\0`, `\xhh`, `\uhhhh`, `\uhhhhh`, `[\b]`
```js
const chessStory = 'He played the King in a8 and she moved her Queen in c2.';
const regexpCoordinates = /\w\d/g;
console.log(chessStory.match(regexpCoordinates));
// expected output: Array [ 'a8', 'c2']

const moods = 'happy ðŸ™‚, confused ðŸ˜•, sad ðŸ˜¢';
const regexpEmoticons = /[\u{1F600}-\u{1F64F}]/gu;
console.log(moods.match(regexpEmoticons));
// expected output: Array ['ðŸ™‚', 'ðŸ˜•', 'ðŸ˜¢']
```
#### More Examples
- Looking for a series of digits
- Looking for a word (from the Latin alphabet) starting with A
- Looking for a word (from Unicode characters)

#### Specifications
- [https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-characterclass](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-characterclass)

### [Groups and ranges](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Groups_and_Ranges)
`(x)`, `(?:x)`, `x|y`, `[xyz]`, `[^xyz]`, `\`_Number_
```js
const aliceExcerpt = 'The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other';
const regexpWithoutE = /\b[a-df-z]+\b/ig;
console.log(aliceExcerpt.match(regexpWithoutE));
// expected output: Array ["and", "at"]

const imageDescription = 'This image has a resolution of 1440Ã—900 pixels.';
const regexpSize = /([0-9]+)Ã—([0-9]+)/;
const match = imageDescription.match(regexpSize);
console.log(`Width: ${match[1]} / Height: ${match[2]}.`);
// expected output: "Width: 1440 / Height: 900."
```
#### More Examples
- Counting vowels
- Using groups
- Using named groups

#### Specifications
[https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-classranges](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-classranges)

### [Quantifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Quantifiers)


```js
const ghostSpeak = 'booh boooooooh';
const regexpSpooky = /bo{3,}h/;
console.log(ghostSpeak.match(regexpSpooky));
// expected output: Array ["boooooooh"]

const modifiedQuote = '[He] ha[s] to go read this novel [Alice in Wonderland].';
const regexpModifications = /\[.*?\]/g;
console.log(modifiedQuote.match(regexpModifications));
// expected output: Array ["[He]", "[s]", "[Alice in Wonderland]"]

const regexpTooGreedy = /\[.*\]/g;
console.log(modifiedQuote.match(regexpTooGreedy));
// expected output: Array ["[He] ha[s] to go read this novel [Alice in Wonderland]"]
```

#### More Examples
- Repeated pattern
- Counting characters
- Optional character
- Greedy versus non-greedy


#### Specifications
