            <li cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"><strong>JavaScript (JS)</strong>  is a lightweight, interpreted, programming language with first-class functions. Most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as node.js and Apache CouchDB. JS is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, dynamic scripting language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.</li>

          The core language of JavaScript is standardized by the ECMA TC39 committee as a language named ECMAScript. "ECMAScript" is the term for the language standard, but "ECMAScript" and "JavaScript" can be used interchangeably. <em>This core language is also used in non-browser environments, for example in Node.js</em>

          This Ecma Standard defines the ECMAScript 2022 Language. It is the thirteenth edition of the ECMAScript Language Specification. Since publication of the first edition in 1997, ECMAScript has grown to be one of the world's most widely used general-purpose programming languages. It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications.
