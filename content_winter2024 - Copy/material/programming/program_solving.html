    <h2>What is problem solving?</h2>
    
    <p>Typical problems are complex. Many problems no longer appear as problems, because we have learned to solve them so well and so quickly that they take little time and little effort.</p>
    <img src="img/image5.png" alt="comic strip on problem solving" style="width:80%;margin:auto;">
    <p>Break down problems and attempt to solve the pieces; attempt to solve each part. Even a simple problem needs to be <strong>planned, analysed, designed, constructed, and tested before it is implemented. </strong> What do you need to know?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Describe the problem in own words</li>  
        <li>State the OBJECTIVE of the problem we are trying to solve</li>  
        <li>Identify the variables for INPUTs and OUTPUTs (ELEMENTS)</li>  
        <li>What constraints need to be identified? (RELATIONS)</li>  
        <li>Model the system: goal + elements + relations.</li>  
    </ol>
    <p>Use simple English (structured) or pseudocode. Include appropriate comments. Err on having too many comments. With practice you will learn to make sound and practical choices what constitutes too much and what is inadequate amount of comments.</p>
    <p>Write out the algorithm. Keep track of constraints and assumptions. Look for improvements and alternatives, and revise.</p>
   
    <h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
    <p>Even a simple problem needs to be planned, analysed, designed, constructed, and tested before it is implemented. Complex problems can be broken down into a set of simple problems.</p>
	<p>Analyze the problem and consider alternate solutions, then select the most appropriate solution for a given situation.</p>
	<ul class="w3-ul">
		<li><strong>Objective:</strong> what is the objective of the problem we are trying to solve?</li>
		<li><strong>Elements:</strong> what are the elements of the problem? (output and input)</li>
		<li><strong>Relations:</strong> what are the relations among the elements of the problem? (functionality, processes)</li>
		<li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> what is the step by step process that makes up the problem?</li>
		<li><strong>Model the system:</strong> prototype and test, identify areas of improvement, changes, alternatives, dependencies, constraints...</li>		
	</ul>	
    <p>Design and implement the selected solution.</p>

            <strong>DOM updates</strong>, specifically layout and paint, are extremely expensive operations, which can be noticed significantly on low-end devices. It is important to <strong>minimize the number of times it is triggered.</strong>
