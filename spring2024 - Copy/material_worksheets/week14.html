                    <li>Please read carefully
                        <ol style="margin-top:2px;padding-top:0;margin-bottom:3px;padding-top:0;">
                          <li>You are required to bring your Sheridan oneCard to all exams at Sheridan. If you do not bring your oneCard, you will not be permitted to write the exam unless you can provide official, valid ID (and your exam will not be graded until you provide a Sheridan oneCard that matches your ID).</li>
                          <li>All phones, smart watches, and other devices must be turned off during the exam (not just silenced or on vibrate: they must be OFF). You may not use/answer your phone, use a smart-watch, or use or use any electronic device during the exam.</li>
                          <li>You will be required to leave all bags, backpacks, purses, phones, tablets, jackets/coats, hats, headphones/headsets, food/beverages, etc. at the front of the room. This list is not exclusive: your professor may have you leave other items at the front of the room. You may retrieve these items once you have submitted your exam.</li>
                          <li>Phones, smart watches, and all other devices must also be left with your belongings at the front of the room. If you are found with a phone, smart watch, or other device at your desk at any time during the exam, you will receive an automatic grade of 0.</li>
                          <li>If you are wearing long, baggy sleeves you will be required to roll them up during the exam.</li>
                          <li>Ear phones, ear pods, or other listening devices are not permitted during the exam (this does not include accessible devices e.g. hearing aid, chochlear implant). If you are found with any listening device at your desk at any time during the exam, you will receive an automatic grade of 0. Disposable foam ear plugs are permitted: you must show them to the professor/invigilator BEFORE insertion into the ear.</li>
                          <li>You may not leave the room for any reason during the exam. You may only leave the room after you have submitted your assigned sheet.</li>
                          <li>You are not permitted to discuss the exam with anyone else while you are writing it. You are not permitted to ask another person for help/advice/etc (except your professor/invigilator).</li>
                          <li>You are not permitted to communicate with any other person during this exam except your professor or an invigilator/proctor. This includes but is not limited to chat communication, voice communication, and forum or discussion board postings, using any device.</li>
                          <li>You may not share/post or otherwise make public or give to anyone else your exam questions or answers during or after the exam. This would constitute a breach of academic integrity on your permanent record and will be dealt with accordingly.</li>
                          <li>Plan ahead!! Make sure you don't sleep in, as that is not a valid reason for missing a test. Make sure you leave for school earlier than normal in case you encounter transportation problems on the way (i.e traffic jam, broken-down bus, etc). If you drive, make sure you have a bus schedule - if your car won't work when you leave for school, you'll have the time and resources to take the bus, instead.</li>
                          <li>If you are late for the exam, you will only be allowed to write the exam if no one else has completed the test and left the room. You will not be given extra time.</li>
                          <li>There are no make-up exams.</li>
