    <h2>Data validation</h2>

<p>There are two different types of form validation which you'll encounter on the web:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client-side validation</strong> is validation that occurs in the browser, before the data has been submitted to the server. This is more user-friendly than server-side validation as it gives an instant response. This can be further subdivided:</li><ol>
<li>JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. It is completely customizable.</li>
<li>Built-in form validation using HTML5 form validation features.  This generally does not require JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript.</li></ol>
<li><strong>Server-side validation</strong> is validation which occurs on the server, after the data has been submitted.  Server-side code is used to validate the data before it is saved into the database. If the data fails authentication, a response is sent back to the client to tell the user what corrections to make. Server-side validation is not as user-friendly as client-side validation, as it does not provide errors until the entire form has been submitted.  However, server-side validation is your application's last line of defense against incorrect or even malicious data. All popular server-side frameworks have features for validating and sanitizing data (making it safe).</li></ul>
<p>In the real world, developers tend to use a combination of client-side and server-side validation.</p>
