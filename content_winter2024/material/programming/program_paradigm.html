            <dd>A developer writes code that describes in exacting detail the steps that the computer must take to accomplish the goal. A computer program is shaped by its 
             data representation and the statements that determine its flow of control. Every program (<em>process</em>) has <em>input</em> and <em>output</em>.</dd>

            A <strong>programming paradigm</strong> is a style of programming. To program professionally, you need to learn either the object-oriented or functional programming paradigms.

        <dl>
            <dt><strong>State</strong></dt> 
            <dd>One of the fundamental differences among the various programming paradigms is the handling of state. State is the value of a program's variables while it is running. Global state is the value of a program's global variables while it is running.</dd>
        </dl>
        
        <dl> 
            <dt><strong>Procedural programming paradigm</strong></dt>
            <dd>Procedural programming paradigm is a programming style in which you write a sequence of steps moving toward a solutionâ€” with each step changing the program's state.You store data in global variables and manipulate it with functions</dd>
         </dl>
        
        <dl>            
            <dt><strong>Functional programming paradigm</strong></dt> 
            <dd>Functional programming paradigm addresses the problems that arise in procedural programming by eliminating global state. A functional programmer relies on functions that do not use or change global state, the only state they use are the parameters you pass to the function. The result, a function returns, is usually passed on to another function. A functional programmer can thus avoid global state by passing it from function to function.</dd>
         </dl>
        
        <dl>            
            <dt><strong>Object-oriented programming paradigm</strong></dt> 
            <dd>Object-oriented programming paradigm also addresses the problems that arise in procedural programming by eliminating global state, but instead of storing state in functions, it is stored in objects.</dd>
