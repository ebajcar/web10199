	Description:
		A two-player game. 
		The players are presented with a board of three-by-three table and a reset button.
		The reset button starts a game where players take turns selecting one of the nine
		available turnsLeft cells with the goal of completing a row, a column, or a diagonal to
		win the game.
		A message specifying which player's turn is presented during the same.
		When a winning state occurs, a message is presented that the game is over.
